Hey folks, it's been a while since I wrote a blog post. I was busy with work and personal stuff.
Recently, I released v2 of [Cligram](https://github.com/Kumneger0/cligram). Today, I want to show what I learned by building this project. This is a walk-through of how the project works. You can take a look at the full project on [GitHub](https://github.com/kumneger0/cligram).
V2 doesn't have new features, but I migrated the UI ([TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface)) part to Go.
Previously, I built it with React. There is an amazing npm package called [Ink](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ink), which is a React renderer just like React DOM for the web and React Native for mobile.
Ink is also a React renderer, but it is for building TUIs ([text-based user interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface)).
It is used by:

- [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) - An agentic coding tool, made by OpenAI
- [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) - An agentic coding tool, made by Anthropic.
- [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) - An agentic coding tool, made by Google
- And many more, check out the list of [projects and companies](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink/blob/master/readme.md#whos-using-ink) to see who is using Ink.

Alright, enough about Ink, you can read more about it [here](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink/blob/master/readme.md).

## OK, what's wrong with Ink?

Nothing! It's great, it's awesome, but it wasn't a perfect fit for my use case.

The other day, I was experimenting with [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) for a tiny [project](https://github.com/Kumneger0/cheztui). It makes building interactive TUIs a breeze. At that time, I was thinking:
> "Should I rewrite Cligram in Go? No, I don't want to rewrite the entire project in Go. Instead, let's rewrite only the UI part in Go while keeping the underlying communication with Telegram servers in JavaScript. Ok, then how can I achieve communication between JavaScript and Go?"

At first, I was thinking of using WebSockets, but that felt like overkill, so I decided to go with [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) over stdio.

## How does Cligram work?

### **Overview**

As I said, the project consists of a JavaScript backend and a Go client.

<DynamicSvg src="/cligram-sequence-diagram.svg" client:load />

### **Go Client**

The Go client is responsible for the interaction with the JavaScript backend.

The JavaScript single executable is embedded using [Go's embed directive](https://pkg.go.dev/embed), which is handy for embedding static assets into your binary.

```go
func GetJSExcutable() (*string, error) {
	cacheDir, err := os.UserCacheDir()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("could not get user cache directory: %w", err)
	}

	appDir := filepath.Join(cacheDir, "cligram")
	if err := os.MkdirAll(appDir, 0755); err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("could not create app cache directory: %w", err)
	}
   
	backendPath := filepath.Join(appDir, "cligram-js-backend") // js backend file path

	// hash the embedded binary
	embeddedHash := sha256.Sum256(assets.JSBackendBinary)
	embeddedHashStr := hex.EncodeToString(embeddedHash[:])

	// open the file on disk
	fileOnDisk, err := os.Open(backendPath)
	if err == nil {

		hasher := sha256.New()
		if _, err := io.Copy(hasher, fileOnDisk); err == nil {
			// get the hash of the file on disk
			diskHashStr := hex.EncodeToString(hasher.Sum(nil))
			// compare the hash with the one we created earlier
			if diskHashStr == embeddedHashStr {	
				fileOnDisk.Close()
				return &backendPath, nil
			}
		}
		fileOnDisk.Close()
	}

	_ = os.Remove(backendPath); // remove the file from the cache if it exists and write the new one
	if err := os.WriteFile(backendPath, assets.JSBackendBinary, 0755); err != nil {
		slog.Error("error writing file", "error", err.Error())
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("could not write embedded backend binary: %w", err)
	}

	return &backendPath, nil
}

```

When you run the app, I create a new SHA256 hash for the embedded JavaScript executable. Then, I look for the executable in the user's cache directory. If it's not there, I write it. If it is there, I hash the cached file and compare it to the embedded one's hash. If they match, we're good to go. If not, I replace the cached file with the new one. This ensures the user always has the latest version of the backend executable. Without this check, it would never get updated, which would be pretty bad.

After getting the executable's path, we run it in a goroutine; this way, it won't block the main thread.

```go
   jsExcutable, err := runner.GetJSExcutable()
   cmd := exec.Command(*jsExcutable)
   stdin, err := cmd.StdinPipe(); // get the stdin pipe
   if err != nil {
      //ignore this
    }
   stdout, err := cmd.StdoutPipe(); // get the stdout pipe
   if err != nil {
    //ignore this one also
  }

```

Then we need to get the command's `stdin` and `stdout` because we need to write to and read from the child process.

After this, the client makes a new JSON-RPC request to get your chat history from JavaScript.
Here is an example JSON-RPC request:

```
Content-Length: 71\r\n\r\n{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getUserChats","params":["user"]}

```

By writing this to the `stdin` of the child process, we are executing a JavaScript function called `getUserChats`. Cool, right?

### JavaScript Backend

Here is what the JavaScript implementation looks like:

```tsx
  async function readHeaders(reader: typeof stdin): Promise<{ [key: string]: string }> {
	const headers: { [key: string]: string } = {};
	let lineBuffer = '';


	while (true) { 
		// read one character at a time
		const chunk = reader.read(1);
		if (chunk === null) {
			await new Promise((resolve) => reader.once('readable', resolve)); // wait for the reader to be readable
			continue;
		}
		const char = chunk.toString('utf8'); // convert the chunk to a string
		lineBuffer += char; // add the character to the line buffer

		if (lineBuffer.endsWith('\r\n') || lineBuffer.endsWith('\n')) {
			let line: string; 
			if (lineBuffer.endsWith('\r\n')) {
				line = lineBuffer.slice(0, -2); // remove the '\r\n' from the line buffer
			} else {
				line = lineBuffer.slice(0, -1);
			}
			// if the line is empty, we break the loop
			if (line === '') {
				break;
			}
			// split the line by ':' eg Content-Length: 69 => ['Content-Length', '69']
			const parts = line.split(':');
			if (parts.length >= 2) {
				// we only have one header, so that's why we are using 0 and 1
				const headerName = parts[0]!.trim();
				const headerValue = parts[1]!.trim();
				headers[headerName] = headerValue;
			}
			lineBuffer = '';
		}
	}
	return headers;
}

  async function readMessage(): Promise<IncomingMessage> {
	const headers = await readHeaders(stdin);
	const contentLengthHeader = Object.keys(headers).find(
		(h) => h.toLowerCase() === 'content-length'
	);

	if (!contentLengthHeader) {
		stderr.write('Error: Missing Content-Length header\n' + stringify(headers) + '\n');
		throw new Error('Missing Content-Length header');
	}
	const length = parseInt(headers[contentLengthHeader!]!, 10);
	if (isNaN(length) || length <= 0) {
		stderr.write('Error: Invalid Content-Length header: ' + headers[contentLengthHeader] + '\n');
		throw new Error('Invalid Content-Length header');
	}
    
	// create a buffer with the exact size
	let payloadBuffer = Buffer.alloc(length);
	let bytesRead = 0;
	while (bytesRead < length) {
		const chunk = stdin.read(length - bytesRead); // read the chunk
		if (chunk === null) {
			await new Promise((resolve) => stdin.once('readable', resolve)); // wait for the reader to be readable
			continue;
		}
		chunk.copy(payloadBuffer, bytesRead); // copy the chunk to the payload buffer
		bytesRead += chunk.length; // add the length of the chunk to the bytes read
	}

	const payload = payloadBuffer.toString('utf8', 0, length);

	try {
		return JSON.parse(payload) as IncomingMessage;
	} catch (e) {
		stderr.write('Error: Failed to parse JSON payload: ' + payload + '\n' + e + '\n');
		throw new Error('Parse error');
	}
}

```

First, we read the header. If you look at the `readHeaders` function carefully, you'll see we're reading one character at a time. We keep reading until we find a `\r\n` or `\n`. This signals the end of the header, and we can construct the header object, which will look like this:

```tsx
const headers = {
 "Content-Length": 69
}
```

After constructing the header, we read the rest of the content. The header is crucial because we create a buffer with the exact size, and we use it to know when we've finished reading. Then we parse it as JSON.
It'll have the following shape:

```tsx
 type JsonRPCRequest = {
  	jsonrpc: '2.0';
		id: number; 
		method: string; // function name we are going to call
		params: []; // parameters
  }
```

Lastly, we call the function, write the result to `stdout`, and then read the `stdout` in Go.
