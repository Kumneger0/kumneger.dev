Hey folks, it's been a while since I last wrote a blog post. I've been busy with work and other things.

Recently, I came across an npm package called Dexie, which is a wrapper for [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) that makes working with IndexedDB a lot easier.

I used Dexie for [TGCloud](https://yourtgcloud.vercel.app/) to cache user files in the browser, and I had an amazing experience with it. I feel like I should write a blog post about it.

In this post, we will build a small note-taking app with Dexie and Vanilla JS. The code for this project is available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kumneger0/Dexie-example).

# Get Started

To get started, we need to create a new project with Vite and install the necessary dependencies.
I'm going to use Tailwind CSS for styling. Instead of installing Tailwind CSS, I will use the CDN for simplicity.

Remove the content of the body and replace it with the following code:

```html
<body>
  <div
    class="flex max-w-screen-md mx-auto flex-col items-center justify-center mt-10"
  >
    <textarea
      id="note-input"
      class="w-full h-32 p-2 border rounded-md"
      placeholder="Type your notes here..."
    ></textarea>
    <button
      id="save-button"
      class="mt-2 p-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-600"
    >
      Save
    </button>
  </div>
  <div id="notes" class="max-w-screen-md mx-auto mt-10">
    <h1>Notes</h1>
  </div>
  <script type="module" src="/src/main.ts"></script>
</body>
```

I have a `<textarea>` element to get the note, a button to save the note, and a `<div>` with the ID of `notes` to render the list of notes. It's pretty basic

# Adding Dexie

To use Dexie, the first thing we need to do is create a Dexie instance and declare our tables and indexes, as shown in the code below:

```tsx
interface Note {
  id: number;
  data: string;
}

const noteDb = new Dexie("Note") as Dexie & {
  note: EntityTable<Note, "id">;
};

noteDb.version(1).stores({
  note: "++id, data",
});
```

I'm using TypeScript for a better experience. We created a Dexie instance and declared our table. We'll use this instance to interact with the underlying IndexedDB

Our `note` table has two fields: `id` and `data`. The `id` is auto-incremented whenever we add new data to the table.

# Displaying notes

The function below takes an array of notes and displays them in the UI. I'm also using `document.createElement` to create elements with JavaScript and adding some Tailwind classes to make it look good.

```tsx
async function renderNotes(notes: Note[] = []) {
  const wrapper = document.createElement("div");

  for (const note of notes) {
    const div = document.createElement("div");
    div.className = "bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg p-4 mb-4";

    div.setAttribute("id", note.id.toString());

    const p = document.createElement("p");
    p.textContent = note.data;
    p.className = "text-gray-800 text-lg";

    const editButton = document.createElement("button");
    editButton.textContent = "Edit";
    editButton.className =
      "bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded hover:bg-blue-600";

    // Edit button event handler
    editButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
      const editInputElement = document.createElement("input");
      editInputElement.value = note.data;
      div.replaceChildren(editInputElement);
      editInputElement.focus();
      editInputElement.addEventListener("keyup", (e) => {
        if (e.key === "Enter") {
          editNote(note.id, editInputElement.value);
          editInputElement.blur();
        }
      });
    });

    const deleteButton = document.createElement("button");
    deleteButton.textContent = "Delete";
    deleteButton.className =
      "bg-red-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded hover:bg-red-600 ml-2";

    // Delete button event handler
    deleteButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
      deleteNote(note.id);
    });

    div.appendChild(p);
    div.appendChild(editButton);
    div.appendChild(deleteButton);

    wrapper.appendChild(div);
  }
  notesWrapper.replaceChildren(wrapper);
}
```

You can see I'm also adding buttons for editing and deleting notes, and I'll explain those later

# Edit Notes

To edit our note, we just need to call `noteDb.note.update` along with the `id` and the new data we want to update. It's that simple!

```tsx
const editNote = (id: number, newValue: string) => {
  noteDb.note.update(id, { data: newValue });
};
```

# Delete Notes

To delete out note we simple need to call `noteDb.note.delete` by providing id of the note

```tsx
const deleteNote = (id: number) => {
  noteDb.note.delete(id);
};
```

finally, we can use the `liveQuery` function from Dexie to subscribe to changes in the database. This lets us listen for any updates. To use `liveQuery`, we just need to call it with a callback function, and it will return an object that has a `subscribe` function. We can use that function to subscribe to changes.

```tsx
const notesObservable = liveQuery(() => noteDb.note.toArray());
const subscription = notesObservable.subscribe({
  next(value) {
    renderNotes(value);
  },
  error(err) {
    console.error("Error: ", err);
  },
});
window.onbeforeunload = () => {
  subscription.unsubscribe();
};
```

The `next` function will get executed every time we make a change to our database.

The `subscribe` function returns a subscription object that we can use to listen for changes.

you can also sync your database with dexie cloud by using their `dexie-cloud-addon` package here is how u can do it

```tsx
const noteDb = new Dexie("Note", { addons: [dexieCloud] }) as Dexie & {
  note: EntityTable<Note, "id">;
};

noteDb.version(1).stores({
  note: "@id, data",
});

noteDb.cloud.configure({
  databaseUrl: "https://<yourdatabase>.dexie.cloud",
  requireAuth: false, // optional
});
```

We also needed to change `++id` to `@id` to switch from auto-incremented to autogenerated.

Then we configured our `databaseUrl`. You could use their CLI to get the `databaseUrl`:

```bash
npx dexie-cloud create

```

Follow the prompts to create the database, and you also needed to whitelist your app origin using the command below; otherwise, it wouldn't work.

```bash
npx dexie-cloud whitelist http://localhost:3000
```
