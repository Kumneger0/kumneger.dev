Hey there 👋 I'm a software developer who loves solving problems with code 👨‍💻.  
I work with TypeScript, React, and Node.js, and I graduated in Computer Science from [Jimma University](https://www.ju.edu.et/) in June 2023.  
Occasionally, I share my insights and knowledge through blog posts, where I aim to share what I've learned and the experiences I've gained.
