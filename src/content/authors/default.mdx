Hey there 👋 I'm Kumneger, yet another guy who loves building.

I mainly work with TypeScript/JavaScript and build things that make life easier. I graduated from [Jimma University](https://www.ju.edu.et/) in June 2024 and currently work as a full-stack developer at [2f-Capital](https://2f-capital.com/).

Sometimes I write blog posts about what I've learned along the way - mostly to share cool stuff I discover and maybe help someone else avoid the same mistakes I made! 😄

### 🛠️ ReactBunode

When React Server Components came out with all the hype, I thought - why not build a simple SSG library to see how it actually works under the hood? So I built this tiny project that has React Server Component support. Sometimes the best way to understand new tech is to build it yourself!

**Tech Stack**: Bun, React

## Where I've Been

### 🎓 Education

Graduated with a BSc in Computer Science from [Jimma University](https://www.ju.edu.et/) in June 2024. Four years of learning, coding, and figuring out what I actually want to do with my life! 😅

### 💼 Work

Currently working as a full-stack developer at [2f-Capital](https://2f-capital.com/) (August 2024 - Present).

Before that, I was at Dynamo Center For Technology (May 2023 - February 2024) as a full-stack developer.
