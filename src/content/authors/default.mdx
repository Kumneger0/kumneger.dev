Hey there üëã I'm a software developer who loves solving problems with code üë®‚Äçüíª.
I mainly focus on TypeScript/JavaScript.
I graduated in Computer Science from [Jimma University](https://www.ju.edu.et/) in June 2024 and currently I work as a full-stack developer at [2f-Capital](https://2f-capital.com/).
Occasionally, I share my insights and knowledge through blog posts, where I aim to share what I've learned and the experiences I've gained.

## Open Source Projects
