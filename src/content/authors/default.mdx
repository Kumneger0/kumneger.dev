Hey there 👋 I'm Kumneger, a software developer from Ethiopia who loves building.

I graduated from [Jimma University](https://www.ju.edu.et/) in June 2024 and currently work as a full-stack developer at [2f-Capital](https://2f-capital.com/).

Sometimes I write blog posts about what I've learned along the way - mostly to share cool stuff I discover and maybe help someone else avoid the same mistakes I made! 😄

I believe in using the right tool for the job and I'm always excited to learn new things. Here are some of the technologies I'm currently working with:

### 🛠️ ReactBunode

When React Server Components came out with all the hype, I thought - why not build a simple SSG library to see how it actually works under the hood? So I built this tiny project that has React Server Component support. Sometimes the best way to understand new tech is to build it yourself!
